## Application Library Engineering Group” Fast track your app development**

1.	Are you looking for Mobile application development?
2.	Are you worried how to search for a library that can help your app development?
3.	Are you looking for a community where you can collaborate and contribute?
4.	Are you looking for any support for your app development?
5.	Are you looking for a quick solution to speed up your app development?
6.	Are you worried that how to integrate the best of different libraries at one place?

  Then you are in the right place to start with………. Here is a platform for you………..here it goes….

In today ever changing technologies for connected device and smartphone gives developers an opportunity across the world to create/innovative solutions/application which can solve important problems for world’s population.  And developer need strong support from community in order to reduce their investment to ease their solution/application development and deployment.

Most of the software components which build in different application/solutions can easily reused for new development instead of redeveloping by each developer across the work.  Most interestingly the development platform for these connect device solution/ application development are many like (Android, IOS, HMOS etc...) And these middleware platforms are getting upgraded drastically year on year.

So there is highest importance and demand for an open source community who can drive innovative reusable software component for all popular platforms so that developer across the world can reuse these software and design libraries in order to fast track their product development and deployment.

“Application Library Engineering Group” Initiative is to bring industry experts, top universities and young developers from across the world to innovate open source reusable components (from UI/UX design to software deployment), which can be made available to large developer community so that developer can focus on building innovative solutions.



***Vision:***

“World’s Innovative open collaborate Platform, build reusable application components (Design to Deployment) to reduce effort and fast track application development on multiple platforms “
